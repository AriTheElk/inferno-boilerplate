# Building via Webpack 2

Thanks to [Webpack 2](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), we can easily compile our application into a few tiny static files. The entire codebase compiles down into a `365kb` build direcotry for me, and it will easily be able to get even slimmer once I begin optimizing it.

## Running the compiler

_using yarn_

```
yarn build
```

_using npm_

```
npm run build
```

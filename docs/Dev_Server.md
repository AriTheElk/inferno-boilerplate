# Development Server

This boilerplate comes equipt with a development server powered by `webpack-dev-server`. The dev server supports [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html) for live reloading :tada:

Although it is _technically possible_, I do not under any circumstance recommend running the dev server in a production environment.

## Running

_using yarn_

```
$ yarn start
```

_using npm_

```
$ npm start
```

Once it starts, your app will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:4000
